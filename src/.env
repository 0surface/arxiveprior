# Compose supports declaring default environment variables in an environment file named .env placed in the folder docker-compose command is executed from (current working directory).
# Compose expects each line in an env file to be in VAR=VAL format. Lines beginning with # (i.e. comments) are ignored, as are blank lines.
# Note: Values present in the environment at runtime will always override those defined inside the .env file. Similarly, values passed via command-line arguments take precedence as well.

# The IP below should be swapped to your real IP or DNS name, like 192.168.88.248, etc. if testing from remote browsers or mobile devices

# Use this values to run the app locally in Windows
# ARX_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP=host.docker.internal

# Use this values to run the app locally in Linux
# ARX_EXTERNAL_DNS_NAME_OR_IP=docker.for.linux.localhost
